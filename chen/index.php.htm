    <tt>Hi Chen, <br>
      <br>
      Attached are two matlab functions for parsing the missing residues
      and missing atoms pdb remarks (465 and 470, resp.; links to their
      format description can be found above each file's header). <br>
      <br>
      Following our discussion --<br>
      <br>
      Breaks found based on CA distances and those found based on pdb
      remarks differ in the following cases: <br>
      <br>
      <u>1. CA distance break, no missing residue (much more common than
        2 below):</u> <br>
      a. For now, I skip non-standard amino acids (HETATM records). That
      can be relatively easily fixed, but we'd have to go through the
      (surprisingly long) list of such AAs (attached) and decide which
      AAs should be included (and, for those excluded, there still be a
      break in CA dist, but not in the sequence). <br>
      <br>
      b. CA-CA distance not in the specified range: ±10% of 3.8A (trans
      peptide bond) or </tt><tt>±10% of 2.95A (cis); examples: 1bn6A,
      165 -- 166 (4.612A), 1c8cA 62 -- 63 (3.288A; interestingly, the
      following pair of CAs are 6.603 apart). We can, obviously, make
      the acceptable range wider, but I suspect it might introduce
      noise, as fraglet libs seem to be focused on "typical" peptide
      bonds. <br>
    </tt><tt><br>
    </tt><u><tt>2. Missing residue, </tt></u><tt><u>typical CA distance
        break:<br>
      </u>a. </tt><tt>Residue(s) seem to be missing, but the distance
      is somehow in the acceptable range; example: 1j96B, 132-136
      missing (remark 465), but 131 -- 137 distance is 4.033 (and, note
      that for a wider range as in 2b above, we'd have even more such
      cases). <br>
      <br>
    </tt><tt>b. Seemingly, an error in the remark; example: 1o6v A465. <br>
      <br>
      c. I'm now considering residue's insertion code (if exists) but I
      incorrectly assumed that the order of those codes is from A to Z
      and, turns out, that it's not always the case. Again, that can be
      easily fixed, but I prefer to move fwd and take care of this
      later. <br>
    </tt><tt><br>
      Let me know if anything is unclear or incorrect. <br>
      <br>
